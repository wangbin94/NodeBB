# Quickstart Plugin for NodeBB

A starter kit for quickly creating NodeBB plugins. Comes with a pre-setup LESS file, server side JS script with an `action:app.load` hook, and a client-side script. Most plugins need at least one of the above, so this ought to save you some time. For a full list of hooks have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/wiki/List-of-Hooks).

Fork this or copy it, and using your favourite text editor find and replace all instances of `nodebb-plugin-quickstart` with `nodebb-plugin-your-plugins-name`. Change the author's name in the LICENSE and package.json files.

Once you're done don't forget to publish it on NPM, and make a thread about it [here](https://docs.nodebb.org/en/latest/plugins/hooks.html).
